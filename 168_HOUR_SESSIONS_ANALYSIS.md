# 168-Hour Sessions Analysis Report

## Summary of Findings

I analyzed the `coaching_sessions` collection in Firebase and found **38 sessions** that are marked as `criticalSessionType: 168_HOUR`. These are the actual 168-hour coaching sessions you were looking for.

## Key Findings

### 1. Coach Name Issues
- **Total 168-hour sessions**: 38
- **Sessions with coach name issues**: 0 (0%)
- **No sessions have "B" or "A" as the coach name**

### 2. Coach Distribution in 168-Hour Sessions
The 168-hour sessions are distributed among these coaches:
- **Rishi**: 14 sessions
- **juli**: 8 sessions  
- **jenny**: 6 sessions
- **Aditi**: 4 sessions
- **jamie**: 1 session
- **unknown**: 5 sessions (these are from MISC or TRIVIAL files where coach wasn't identified)

### 3. Data Quality
All properly identified sessions have:
- Full coach names (not single letters like "B" or "A")
- Proper student names
- Week numbers
- Session dates
- Good data extraction

### 4. Sessions with "unknown" Coach
The 5 sessions with "unknown" coach are:
1. TRIVIAL sessions (2 instances) - these are short trivial meetings
2. MISC sessions (3 instances) - miscellaneous files where metadata extraction failed

## Conclusion

**The 168-hour sessions do NOT have the coach naming issue** that was seen in the game plan sessions. The coach names in these critical 168-hour sessions are properly extracted and stored with full names like "Rishi", "juli", "jenny", etc.

The naming issue with "B" or "A" as coach names appears to be limited to:
1. Game plan sessions (as shown in previous analysis)
2. Some entries in the `indexed_videos` collection

But the actual 168-hour coaching sessions in the `coaching_sessions` collection have correct coach name data.

## Sample 168-Hour Sessions

Here are a few examples showing the proper data structure:

1. **Rishi & Aarav - Week 19**
   - Coach: Rishi ✓
   - Student: Aarav ✓
   - Week: 19
   - Date: 2025-05-13

2. **juli & Ananyaa - Week 22**
   - Coach: juli ✓
   - Student: Ananyaa ✓
   - Week: 22
   - Date: 2025-06-03

3. **jenny & Arshiya - Week 16**
   - Coach: jenny ✓
   - Student: Arshiya ✓
   - Week: 16
   - Date: 2025-06-04

All of these have proper coach names, not single letters.
