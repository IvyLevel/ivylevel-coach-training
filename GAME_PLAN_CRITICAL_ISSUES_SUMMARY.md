# Game Plan Sessions - Critical Issues Summary

## Issue Analysis Results

Based on the analysis of the database, there are several critical issues with Game Plan sessions:

### 1. Duration Issue: "5:00" Format
- **Problem**: 43 out of 46 Game Plan sessions show duration as "5:00"
- **Impact**: The ModernKnowledgeBase component's `formatDuration` function interprets "5:00" as 5 minutes (since it's < 60)
- **Reality**: Game Plans are typically 1-2 hour sessions (60-120 minutes)
- **Root Cause**: The import process is storing duration in "minutes:seconds" format, but for these long videos, "5:00" likely means something else entirely

### 2. Coach Assignment Issue
- **Expected**: All Game Plans should show "Jenny" as coach (head coach who leads all game plans)
- **Reality**: 44 out of 46 Game Plans correctly show "Jenny"
- **Issues Found**: 2 sessions show no coach (parsedCoach: null) for student "Advay"

### 3. Specific Example Confirmed
The reported example was found in the database:
```
Document ID: AyOgiZjMQWd8R8wrqFwW
Title: Jenny & Ananyaa - Game Plan - Week 1 (2024-09-06)
Filename: Coaching_GamePlan_B_Jenny_Ananyaa_Wk1_2024-09-06_M_fe05e4db11c4b53bU_fe05e4db11c4b53b.mp4
Parsed Coach: "Jenny" ✅ (Correct)
Duration: "5:00" ❌ (Shows as 5 minutes, but actual video is 1hr 29min)
```

## Critical Findings

### Duration Pattern Analysis
Looking at all Game Plan durations:
- 43 sessions: "5:00" (interpreted as 5 minutes)
- 1 session: "26:00" (26 minutes - more reasonable)
- 1 session: "47:00" (47 minutes - reasonable)
- 1 session: "28:00" (28 minutes - reasonable)

The "5:00" appears to be a default or placeholder value, NOT the actual duration.

### Where Duration "5:00" Comes From
1. It's stored directly in the database as "5:00"
2. The import process likely defaulted to this value
3. The formatDuration function correctly interprets it as 5 minutes
4. The actual video files are much longer (1-2 hours typically)

## Recommended Fixes

### 1. Immediate Fix for Duration Display
Update the `formatDuration` function in ModernKnowledgeBase.js to handle Game Plan sessions specially:

```javascript
const formatDuration = (duration, sessionType) => {
  if (!duration) return '30m';
  
  // Special handling for Game Plans with "5:00" duration
  if (sessionType === 'game_plan_session' && duration === '5:00') {
    return '~90m'; // Display approximate typical duration
  }
  
  // ... rest of existing logic
};
```

### 2. Database Fix Script
Create a script to update all Game Plan sessions with "5:00" duration to a more accurate default:

```javascript
// Fix all game plans with suspicious "5:00" duration
const fixGamePlanDurations = async () => {
  const gamePlans = await db.collection('indexed_videos')
    .where('sessionType', '==', 'game_plan_session')
    .where('duration', '==', '5:00')
    .get();
    
  const batch = db.batch();
  gamePlans.forEach(doc => {
    batch.update(doc.ref, {
      duration: '90:00', // 90 minutes default
      durationNote: 'Default duration - actual may vary'
    });
  });
  
  await batch.commit();
};
```

### 3. Import Process Fix
The import process needs to be updated to:
- Fetch actual video duration from Google Drive API
- Store duration in a consistent format (total minutes as number)
- Add metadata about duration source

### 4. Coach Name Verification
While most Game Plans correctly show Jenny, the 2 sessions with missing coach data need to be fixed:
- Student: Advay
- These show "unknown" in filename and null in parsedCoach

## Data Integrity Recommendations

1. **Add validation** to ensure all Game Plans have:
   - Coach = "Jenny"
   - Reasonable duration (> 30 minutes)
   - Proper category and sessionType

2. **Update import process** to:
   - Validate coach assignment for Game Plans
   - Fetch actual video duration from Drive
   - Log warnings for suspicious data

3. **Add monitoring** to alert when:
   - Game Plans are imported without Jenny as coach
   - Durations are suspiciously short (< 30 min)
   - Required fields are missing
