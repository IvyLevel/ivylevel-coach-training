## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install googleapis @sendgrid/mail firebase-admin
```

### 2. Configure Environment
Create `.env.local` with your credentials:
```env
# Firebase
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id

# Google Drive
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_FILE=./credentials/service-account.json
GOOGLE_DRIVE_ROOT_FOLDER_ID=your_folder_id

# SendGrid (optional)
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_key
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

### 3. Add Credentials
Place service account files in `/credentials/`:
- `service-account.json` - Google Cloud service account
- `firebase-admin.json` - Firebase Admin SDK

### 4. Initialize Database
```bash
node scripts/initializeFirestore.js
node scripts/createTestData.js
```

### 5. Test Integration
```bash
node scripts/testIntegration.js
```

### 6. Run Application
```bash
npm start
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: All users must authenticate via Firebase
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control (admin/coach)
3. **Data Protection**: Firestore security rules enforce access
4. **Resource Access**: Google Drive maintains view-only permissions
5. **API Keys**: Store all credentials securely in environment variables

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Google Drive API Not Working**
   - Check service account credentials
   - Verify API is enabled in Google Cloud Console
   - Ensure folder permissions are set correctly

2. **Emails Not Sending**
   - Verify SendGrid API key is correct
   - Check from email is verified
   - In development, check console for email output

3. **Resources Not Indexing**
   - Verify Google Drive folder ID
   - Check service account has access to folder
   - Run manual index: `node scripts/indexResources.js`

4. **Firebase Connection Issues**
   - Verify Firebase configuration in .env.local
   - Check Firestore is enabled in Firebase Console
   - Ensure security rules are deployed
