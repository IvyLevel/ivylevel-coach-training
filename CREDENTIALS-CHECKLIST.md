## üÜò Common Issues

**"File not found" error?**
- Make sure files are in `/credentials/` folder
- Check file names are exactly: `firebase-admin.json` and `service-account.json`

**"Permission denied" for Google Drive?**
- Did you share the folder with the service account email?
- Is the email exactly as shown in Google Cloud Console?
- Try removing and re-adding the share

**Project ID mismatch?**
- The project_id in firebase-admin.json should match REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID in .env.local
