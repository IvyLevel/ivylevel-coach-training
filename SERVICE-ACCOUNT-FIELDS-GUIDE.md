|-------|-----------------|

## Important Email to Copy

After creating, you'll have a service account email that looks like:
```
ivylevel-drive-access@your-project-123456.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

**Copy this email!** You need it to share your Google Drive folder.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid:

1. **Don't select any roles** in Step 3 - just click Continue
2. **Don't add any users** in Step 4 - just click Done  
3. **Don't forget to download the JSON key** - it won't let you download it again
4. **Don't lose the service account email** - you need it for Drive sharing

## What the Downloaded File Looks Like:

The `service-account.json` file will look similar to this:
```json
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "your-project-123456",
  "private_key_id": "some-long-id",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nVERY-LONG-KEY-HERE\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
  "client_email": "ivylevel-drive-access@your-project-123456.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "client_id": "123456789",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/..."
}
```

## Next Step: Share Your Drive Folder

1. Go to Google Drive
2. Right-click your resources folder
3. Click "Share"
4. Paste the `client_email` from the JSON file (the one ending in `.iam.gserviceaccount.com`)
5. Set to "Viewer"

That's it! You've successfully created your service account.
