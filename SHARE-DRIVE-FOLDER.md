# Share Google Drive Folder with Service Account

## The Issue
Your service account (`ivylevel-drive-access@ivylevel-coaching-sessions.iam.gserviceaccount.com`) doesn't have access to the Google Drive folder.

## Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Find Your IvyLevel Resources Folder
- Go to: https://drive.google.com
- Locate your folder with coach training resources (videos, documents, etc.)
- It might be named something like:
  - "IvyLevel Resources"
  - "Coach Training Materials"
  - "Coaching Sessions"
  - Or similar

### 2. Get the Correct Folder ID
- Open the folder
- Look at the URL in your browser
- It will look like: `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/XXXXXXXXXXXXX`
- Copy the ID part (the XXXXXXXXXXXXX after /folders/)

### 3. Share the Folder
- Right-click on the folder
- Click "Share"
- In the "Add people and groups" field, paste:
  ```
  ivylevel-drive-access@ivylevel-coaching-sessions.iam.gserviceaccount.com
  ```
- Make sure it's set to **"Viewer"**
- **IMPORTANT**: Uncheck "Notify people" (service accounts can't receive emails)
- Click "Share"

### 4. Update Your Environment File
- Open `/Users/snazir/ivylevel-coach-training/.env.local`
- Update the folder ID:
  ```
  GOOGLE_DRIVE_ROOT_FOLDER_ID=YOUR_NEW_FOLDER_ID_HERE
  ```

### 5. Test Access Again
```bash
node scripts/checkDriveAccess.js
```

You should now see:
- âœ… Folder accessed successfully!
- List of files and folders inside

### 6. Index Your Resources
Once access is confirmed:
```bash
node scripts/indexGoogleDrive.js
```

## What Folder Should I Share?

Share the main folder that contains:
- ðŸ“¹ Training session videos (like Marissa & Iqra sessions)
- ðŸ“„ Game plan documents
- ðŸ“‹ Execution templates
- ðŸ“š Coach training materials
- ðŸŽ¯ Student success stories

The script will automatically scan all subfolders and organize resources by:
- Coach names (Kelvin, Noor, Jamie)
- Student types (biomed, CS, business)
- Resource types (videos, documents, templates)

## Alternative: Create a Test Folder

If you want to test first:
1. Create a new folder in Google Drive called "IvyLevel Test Resources"
2. Add a few sample files
3. Share it with the service account
4. Use that folder ID for testing
