   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=
   ```

2. **Firebase Console Setup**:
   - Authentication enabled with Email/Password provider
   - Firestore database created
   - Security rules configured (development mode OK for testing)

3. **Local Development**:
